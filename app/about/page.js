                After finding my grandma's disposable camera on the kitchen sink, I looked down the viewfinder and was immediately fascinated at the fact that I could record absolutely anything and play it back. That day, I realized I could capture life in a whole new way; I was hooked. Around the summer of 2023, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to share the art of videography with others in an impactful and meaningful way that could return a high rate of value. I started this videography business with the hope that the same passion I found in videography at the age of 8 would spark excitement in others as well. Veca Vision Media was created to show that passion through each and every frame, leaving you and your audience in awe.
